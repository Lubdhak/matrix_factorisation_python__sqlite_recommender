Future Development
-----------
- Use of Apiori Algorithm to leverage items that are mostly brought together

Other side of Matrix Factorisation 
-----------
In Matrix Factorisation the weights are learnt by itself which is great when the data is sparse & most traditional model fails to deal with this scenario but over the time when data gets dense there is no scope of improvement cause: 

- We cannot add any extra weight externally
- The vector length is fixed so any feature prior or post User-item interaction cannot be taken into consideration
- All correlation between features are treated naively hence we cannot include any constant or variable human factors into the computation hence it under-fits dense data
- Generalisation is the strength of Matrix Factorisation Models and Also the weakness
- Over the time itâ€™ll start recommending product with very less confidence score
- Appart from Suggestions there are situation like sending Email / Push notifications to the users requires items to have very high confidence score.
